Printer Config CLI for MS Windows

Basic printer administration functions are available at the Windows command line,
but complex commands are required to locate and execute the VBS scripts exposed in
the Windows/System32 directory.  While many powerful functions are available, they
are spread across a number of scripts. 

This script aims to implement a uniform command-line native interface to these
printer administration scripts.
